TeaVM Flavour is a subproject of TeaVM.
Its purpose is to provide developer with high-level services for writing web applications with [TeaVM](http://teavm.org/).
This includes the following features:

* reactive type-safe HTML templates;
* routing;
* serialization to JSON;
* REST (JAX-RS) client.

TeaVM Flavour is for developers, who like concepts of Knockout, Angular, Backbone, etc, but would like to write their web applications on Java, both backend and frontend.
The framework won't include much for backend developers.
Instead, it will be tightly integrated with existing Java infrastructure, including Java EE, Spring, JAX-RS, etc.

Currently, project lacks documentation.
