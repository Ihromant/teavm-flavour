TeaVM Flavour is subproject of TeaVM.
Its purpose is to provide developer with high-level services for writing web applications with [TeaVM](http://teavm.org/).
This includes the following features:

* reactive type-safe HTML templates;
* routing;
* JAX-RS client and Jackson annotations;
* dependency injection.

TeaVM Flavour is for developers, who like concepts of Knockout, Angular, Backbone, etc, but would like to write their web applications on Java, both backend and frontend.
The framework won't include much for backend developers.
Instead, it will be tightly integrated with existing Java infrastructure, including Java EE, Spring, JAX-RS, etc.

**The project is in its very early stage!**
If you are looking for examples and documentation, please, give up for now.
They'll be here as soon as possible, no sooner than there will be the first working prototype of the framework.
